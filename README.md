# 🕊️ PeaceDAO Demo  
**Token-Verified DAO Chat & Governance Prototype**  

---

### 💡 Vision
Decentralization without verification leads to chaos.  
PeaceDAO explores a **token-verified governance framework** that gives identity, accountability, and structure to decentralized communities.

> *"Peace needs protection — even on-chain."* ☮️

---

### 🧱 Core Concept
A **token-verified DAO chat** where:
- Holders can **read / speak**  
- Mid-tier holders can **vote**  
- Core contributors can **propose**

Roles are automatically granted by **smart-contract verification** of ERC-20 token balances,  
transforming every holder into a *stakeholder*.

### ⚙️ Smart Contract Overview
**Contracts:**  
- `PeaceGate.sol` — role verification & access control  
  - Defines thresholds for reader / voter / proposer  
  - Blacklist management for scam prevention  
  - Emits events for bot monitoring and audit logs  
- `PeaceDAO.sol` — proposal & voting logic  
  - Snapshot-optional voting model  
  - Simple quorum-based execution flag  
  - Emits detailed proposal and vote events  

Example thresholds:
```
1 token  → read/talk  
10 tokens → vote  
100 tokens → propose
```

---

### 🧩 Current Features
- ✅ On-chain role checking via `roleOf(address)`  
- ✅ Proposal creation & voting  
- ✅ Blacklist & admin control  
- ✅ Event-based integration for bot verification (Discord/TG)  
- ⚙️ Adjustable parameters for voting delay, period, quorum

### 🔐 Security & Next Steps
This repository is a **concept demo — not for mainnet deployment**.  
Future improvements include:
1. Snapshot-based voting integration (using `ERC20Snapshot` or Governor).  
2. Role verification via multisig / timelock for additional security.  
3. Expand event logging for audit trails (`RoleGranted`, `Blacklisted`, etc.).  
4. Integrate with a treasury contract (`Gnosis Safe + Timelock`).  
5. Re-entrancy and overflow protection with OpenZeppelin libraries.

### 🤖 Token-Gated Chat Integration
**Goal:** connect contract logic to real community platforms.

Suggested tools:
- Discord / Telegram → [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) or [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/)  
- Web gating → [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/)  
- Voting UI → [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) / [Tally](https://tally.xyz/)  
- Treasury execution → [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)  

**Bot verification logic (simplified):**
1. User clicks *Verify* → bot requests wallet signature (no private key).  
2. Bot checks `roleOf(address)` via RPC.  
3. Grants appropriate chat role (reader / voter / proposer).  
4. Periodically revalidates or on-demand before voting.

### 🧠 Why This Matters
Scams in open Telegram communities show how fragile trust can be.  
By introducing **on-chain verified access**, communities can stay open yet secure.  
It’s not about centralization — it’s about *verified decentralization*.
